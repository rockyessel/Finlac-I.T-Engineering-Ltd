Finlac IT & Engineering is a CCTV website that allows customers to contact professionals for help with the installation or repair of CCTV systems. This documentation provides an overview of the project, including the tools used, features added, and any challenges faced during development.

# Tools and Technologies

The project was built using the following tools and technologies:

TailwindCSS - a utility-first CSS framework used for styling the website.

Next.js - a React-based framework used for building server-side rendered web applications.

Sanity.io - a headless CMS (Content Management System) used to manage the content of the website.

TailwindCSS was chosen for its ease of use and flexibility in styling web pages. Next.js was chosen for its performance and ability to provide server-side rendering for improved SEO. Sanity.io was chosen for its user-friendly interface and ease of use in managing website content.

# Design

The design of the Finlac IT & Engineering website was entirely handled by me, using tools such as Figma for creating the website's design. The website was designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use, with a clean and modern layout.

The colour scheme used for the website was kept simple, with a dominant shade of red used throughout the website to provide a consistent and professional look. The font choice for the website was also kept simple, with clear and legible fonts used throughout to ensure easy readability.

The layout of the website was designed to be easy to navigate, with a clear menu that allows users to quickly find the information they need. The home page includes a prominent call to action button to encourage users to contact the client for their CCTV needs.

Overall, the design of the Finlac IT & Engineering website is simple, modern, and easy to use, with a focus on providing users with a clean and professional experience.
